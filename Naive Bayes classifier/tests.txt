Примеры для распознания:
* 0-1. фрагменты из Википедии
* 2-3. фрагменты из худ. текстов
* 4. текст из топика за 9 класс на историческую тему (содержит признаки обеих классов, думаю, вне зависимости от результата параметр уверенности будет невелик)

Программа работала в адаптивном режиме, преключилась на "центр" в трех примерах.
Все примеры распознаны верно, на удивление, "уверенность" в последнем примере была велика. (он был отнечен к худ. текстам)

0 The religion Zoroastrianism is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder Zoroaster is thought to have lived and died in Balkh
0 In 2002 the cathedral embarked on what was hoped to be a fifteen-year project to restore the east end, the west front and the central tower and spire. Each of the projects would be undertaken as funds allowed.
0 At this time honours for Australians were still being awarded in the UK honours on the advice of the premiers of Australian states. The Australian honours system began with the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours.
0 In the second half of the nineteenth century, hysteria was well-established as a diagnosis for certain psychiatric disorders. Although the original anatomical explanation of hysteria, the so-called wandering womb, was by this point abandoned, the diagnoses remained associated with (gender stereotypes of) females and female sexuality in the minds of physicians.
1 My aunt was a big woman, very tall, with a strong mind and will. She was what you may call a very manly woman. My uncle was a thin, small man, very weak, with no will at all. He was no match for my aunt. From the day of their marriage he began to grow smaller and weaker. His wife’s powerful mind was too much for him; it undermined his health, and very soon he fell ill.
1 Mimi went off to call their staff. Two minutes later Alberto and Mimi’s head of staff was out in the garden trying to get rid of the unwelcome neighbour. ‘Go on!’ he shouted. ‘Get out of here!  Go home!’ The neighbour didn’t say anything, but gave Alberto and Mimi’s head of staff a dirty look, then he went back into his garden. Alberto and Mimi felt better, and then asked their head of staff to prepare their lunch for them.
1 Joe Larrabee dreamed of becoming a great artist. Even when he was six, people in the little western town where he lived used to say, «Joe has great talent, he will become a famous artist.» At twenty, he left his home town and went to New York. He had his dreams — but very little money.
In other words he had guessed at a glance that I was a professor. The manager of the biggest book store cannot be deceived in a customer. He knew I would hang around for two hours, get in everybody’s way, and finally buy the Dialogues of Plato for ten cents.
The children pressed to each other like so many roses, so many weeds, intermixed, peering out for a look at the hidden sun.
He served as a missionary in India for three years (1847–1850). He held pastorates at Lower West Nottingham, Maryland (1851–1855), Fredericksburg, Virginia (1855–1861), and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania (1861–1864). In 1864 he accepted a call to the chair of systematic theology in Western Theological Seminary (later Pittsburgh Theological Seminary) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There he remained until in 1877 he was called to Princeton to be the associate of his father, Charles Hodge, in the distinguished chair of systematic theology. He took on the full responsibilities of the chair of systematic theology in 1878.
The original library was based on a book collection donated by Anne Cline, a retired schoolteacher and Altamonte Springs community leader.[3] Cline, as President of the Altamonte Springs Civic Club, saw the potential to create a community library in 1959. At the time, the closest public library was in Winter Park. Unfortunately, Cline died before her plans could be completed.
Britain developed its Constitution pretty gradually. It was a monarchy when it was formed and it is still now. Of course, many things changed. The colonies are now independent. But there isn't a British National Day moment that defines the modern nation. The United Kingdom is a military sovereign state but it has four countries in it: England, which everyone associated with Great Britain, but it just a part of it; Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales.

ТЕСТ 3. Те же тесты распознания, обучающий корпус расширен:

Класс 0 - статьи из Википедии, фрагменты из пункта "история" (10 шт)
Класс 1 - худ. тексты школьного уровня (7 шт)
Примеры для распознания:
* 0-1. фрагменты из Википедии
* 2-3. фрагменты из худ. текстов
* 4. текст из топика за 9 класс на историческую тему (содержит признаки обеих классов, думаю, вне зависимости от результата параметр уверенности будет невелик)

Во всех случаях было переключение на центральный алгоритм. 
Судя по всему из-за схожести классов и малого числа примеров множество слов из тестов на распознание были в обучающих экземпляров различных классов
но так как экземпляров все еще мало наличие признака в экземпляре только одного класса не было характеристикой класса, в было вызвано случайностью

Менее точный центральный алгоритм показал большую вероятность ошибки, хотя стоит отметить, что "уверенность" во всех неверных ответах была
(хоть и несужественно), но ниже, чем во всех верных.
Те тестовые запросы, которые раньше отсеимались наличием уникальных признаков одного класса при расширении "словарей" классов не были корректно
отнесены "центральным" алгоритмом.
Тест 4 по прежнему отнесен к первому классу, но теперь уверенность крайне мала.

0 which he did not like very much, and almost stopped completely until his parents bought him an electric guitar at a yard sale. The young Schuldiner immediately took to the instrument and began playing, writing and teaching himself. He was known to spend the weekend in the garage or his room playing his guitar but was limited to three hours on weekdays when school was in session. Schuldiner first played in public in his early teens.
0 The combination of loud and heavy blues rock with psychedelic rock and acid rock formed much of the original basis for heavy metal. The variant or subgenre of psychedelic rock often known as "acid rock" was particularly influential on heavy metal; acid rock is often defined as a heavier, louder, or harder variant of psychedelic rock, or the more extreme side of the psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and heavily distorted guitar-centered sound. Acid rock has been described as psychedelic rock at its "rawest and most intense," emphasizing the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience rather than only the idyllic side of psychedelia.
0 Gasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that the client wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.
0 During the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and the following Muromachi period (1336–1573), Japanese architecture made technological advances that made it somewhat diverge from its Chinese counterpart. In response to native requirements such as earthquake resistance and shelter against heavy rainfall and the summer heat and sun, the master carpenters of this time responded with a unique type of architecture, creating the Daibutsuyō and Zenshūyō styles.
0 The repulsions of two Mongol invasions were momentous events in Japanese history. Nichiren had predicted these invasions years earlier, in his Rissho Ankoku Ron, a letter to the regency. Japanese relations with China had been terminated in the mid-ninth century after the deterioration of late Tang dynasty China and the turning inward of the Heian court. Some commercial contacts were maintained with the Southern Song dynasty of China in later centuries, but Japanese pirates made the open seas dangerous. At a time when the shogunate had little interest in foreign affairs and ignored communications from China and the Goryeo kingdom, news arrived in 1268 of a new Mongol regime in Beijing. Its leader, Kublai Khan, demanded that the Japanese pay tribute to the new Yuan dynasty and threatened reprisals if they failed to do so. Unused to such threats, Kyoto raised the diplomatic counter of Japan's divine origin, rejected the Mongol demands, dismissed the Korean messengers, and started defensive preparations.
0 Philo of Byzantium provides probably the most detailed account on the establishment of a theory of belopoietics (belos = "projectile"; poietike = "(art) of making") circa 200 BC. The central principle to this theory was that "all parts of a catapult, including the weight or length of the projectile, were proportional to the size of the torsion springs". This kind of innovation is indicative of the increasing rate at which geometry and physics were being assimilated into military enterprises.

He was no match for my aunt. From the day of their marriage he began to grow smaller and weaker. His wife’s powerful mind was too much for him; it undermined his health, and very soon he fell ill.

1 When I was quite young, my family had one of the first telephones in our neighborhood. I remember welle he lived the polished oak case fastened to the wall on the lower stair landing. The shiny receiver hung on the side of the box. I even remembered the number — 105. I was too little to reach the telephone, but used to listen with fascination when my mother talked into it. Once she lifted me up to speak to my father, who was away on business. Magic! Then I discovered that somewhere inside that wonderful device lived an amazing person — her name was «Information Please» and there was nothing that she did not know. My mother could ask her for anybody’s number and when our clock ran down, Information Please immediately supplied the correct time.
1 All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. Then, when I was nine years old, we moved across the country to Boston-and I missed my mentor acutely. Information Please belonged in that old wooden box back at home, and I somehow never thought of trying the tall, skinny new phone that sat on the small table in the hall. Yet, as I grew into my teens, the memories of those childhood conversation never really left me; often in moments of doubt and perplexity I would recall the serene sense of security I had when I know that I could call Information Please and get the right answer. I appreciated now how very patient, understanding and kind she was to have wasted her time on a little boy.
1 The man who got off the boat at Harwich had a short black beard. There was nothing to show that he had a gun in his coat pocket, and nothing to show that he was one of the cleverest men in Europe. He was Valentin, the chief of the Paris police, and the most famous detective in the world. He was coming from Brussels to London to make the most important arrest of the century. Flambeau was in England. and the police of three countries were trying to catch this famous thief.
1 It was not a new idea. Weeks before, he had thought about what could happen there. The idea came when the doctor gave him some powders to help him sleep. He thought about giving Dunn enough of them to kill him, but then he got a better idea. Although he was afraid, Thwaite slowly realized that murder was the only answer to his problem.
In other words he had guessed at a glance that I was a professor. The manager of the biggest book store cannot be deceived in a customer. He knew I would hang around for two hours, get in everybody’s way, and finally buy the Dialogues of Plato for ten cents.

ТЕСТ 4.

Класс 0 - описания персонажей австралийского сериала "All Saints" (8 шт)
Класс 1 - синопсисы серий сериала "Star Trek: The Next Generation" (8 шт)
Все таксты взяты из соответствующих статей в Википедии.
Примеры для распознания:
* 0-5. синопсисы серий
* 6-9. описания персонажей

Корректность распознания низкая, в основном верная классификазия происходит при помощи "классического" алгоритма за счет уникальных признаков.
"Центральный" алгоритм включается 5 раз. Суммарно распознано верно 6 примеров, допущенно 4 ошибки, классический алгоритм ошибся 1 раз, центральный 3 раза.

Судя по всему ошибки также как и в предыдущий раз продиктованы недостаточным массивом данных для обучения, на столь малом массиве существенно влияние случайных
колебаний частотности встерч тех или иных слов в экземплярах для обучения. Так как лексика этих двух классио существенно различается, "классический" алгоритм в этот
раз споравлялся чаще.
